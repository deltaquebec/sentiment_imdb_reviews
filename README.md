# Data Visualization and Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews across Four Neural Network NLP Models

This goal of this project is twofold: 1) practice with data exploration and visualization 2) classify sentiment polarity of IMBD reviews as "positive" or "negative". The latter is achieved through four neural network models, whose performances are compared. These goals serve as a learning tool and experience for data visualization and for building neural networks.

The project is arranged as follows:

1. Visualization
- Data preparation and data cleaning
- Wordcloud representations
- n-gram (mono-,bi-,tri-gram)
- Number of characters in text
- Number of words in text
- Average word length represented as probability density
2. Neural Network Models
- CNN
- RNN
- RCNN
- LSTM
